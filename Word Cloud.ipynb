Due to the nature of our business as a triple-net REIT, our use of vendors is fairly limited. However, Spirit expects any vendor it utilizes to have the same commitment and adherence to ethical standards as Spirit does, including compliance with applicable laws related to human rights such as prohibiting child and forced labor, and human trafficking and implementing and maintaining health and safety policies and procedures of employees and workplace facilities. As set forth in the Company’s Human Rights Policy, we are committed to the protection of fundamental human rights and expect the same commitment from Vendors. We expect Vendors to ensure that all labor is voluntary and that they are not supporting or engaging slavery or human trafficking in any part of their supply chain. We expect that Vendors will not, and will ensure that their Partners do not, support or engage in, or require any: • compelled, involuntary, or forced labor; • labor to be performed by children; • bonded labor; • indentured labor; or • prison labor. Follow all laws governing wages and working hours, including laws related to child labor, minimum age requirements, fair compensation, benefits and overtime Conduct employment practices in accordance with all laws and regulations including, but not limited to, prohibiting the use of involuntary and child labor, complying with wage and hour laws and, if applicable, affording employees freedom of association and the opportunity to engage in collective bargaining.

We aim to implement and enforce effective systems and controls that promote workplaces free from child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking, while also supporting fair wages and safe and humane working conditions. We expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, Vendors, and other business partners.  No Child Labor WeWork does not tolerate child labor. Vendors shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their country of production or operations regarding age appropriate work.   Vendors should take appropriate measures to ensure that no workers under the legal age for employment are used at their own place of production or operations or at their subcontractors’ place(s) of production or operations.  Vendors should protect young workers of legal working age from any type of employment or work likely to jeopardise their health, safety or morals.  According to law, this includes preventing young workers from performing hazardous jobs and avoiding night shifts, and ensuring minimum wages. //No Forced Labor WeWork has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery. Forced or bonded labor must never be used in the production or services supplied to WeWork. For more information regarding our Modern Slavery statement, please see www.wework.com/legal/uk-modern-slavery-statement.

Vendor is responsible for respecting human rights in its operations and will comply with the standards set forth in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The standards set forth in this Code apply to all workers, including, without limitation, temporary, student, contract, direct employees, and any other type of worker of Vendor. The applicable labor standards are: 1. Child Labor. Vendor will not engage in or condone the unlawful employment or exploitation of children in the workplace. Vendor will be committed to combating the exploitation of children, and therefore prohibit any use of child labor with any vendor, supplier or other thirdparty arrangements. Vendor is expected to cooperate with law enforcement authorities to address any such instances of which Vendor becomes aware. 2. Human Trafficking, Slavery and the Right to Voluntary Labor. Vendor will respect the free choice of all persons and strictly prohibit forced or compulsory labor for any employees. Vendor will refrain from doing business with, tolerate, or associate with organizations or entities that condone or are engaged in the practice of coercing or imposing work with little or no freedom of choice. Vendor will comply with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and will cooperate with law enforcement to address such instances that come to the attention of Vendor. The use of child labor is prohibited. No person under the age of 15 (or under 14 where\\npermitted by local law) may be employed. Workers under the age of 18 may not perform\\nwork that is likely to jeopardize their health or safety. This Vendor Code of Conduct ensures that our Supply Chain Partners operate in a manner which is aligned with A&F’s principles and values, as reflected in A&F’s Code of Business Conduct. //Bribery and refusal by a factory to be audited are considered a “zero tolerance” finding, and, if found, A&F will stop business with the factory.//Child Labor\\nA&F will not tolerate the use of child labor by its vendors. ‘Child Labor’ is defined as the employment of persons younger than the age of 15, the local legal minimum working age, or the local legal age for compulsory education, whichever is older.\\n\\nJuvenile Workers\\nJuvenile workers are those workers under the age of 18.

It is permissible to utilize legitimate workplace\\napprenticeship programs that comply with all relevant laws and regulations. Workers under\\nthe age of 18 (Young Workers) shall not perform work that is likely to jeopardize their health\\nor safety, including nightshift and overtime. As it pertains to student workers, Suppliers must\\nensure proper management of student records, continued, thorough diligence of educational\\npartners, and protection of students’ rights in accordance with applicable law and\\nregulations. Supplier shall provide appropriate support and training to all student workers. In\\nthe absence of local law, the wage rate for student workers, interns and apprentices shall\\nbe at least the same wage rate as other entry-level workers performing equal or similar\\ntasks. This Supplier Code of Conduct (the “Code”) sets forth the basic requirements that all Suppliers must comply\\nwith when doing business with Alliance Data. The Code helps us ensure that Alliance Data and the Suppliers\\nwho help us achieve our success, conduct business with the utmost integrity. Much like our associates are\\nheld to a Code of Ethics, we expect the same from you as a Supplier.   //   Alliance Data treats its associates and all our partners with professionalism, dignity and respect. We will not\\ntolerate the use of child or forced labor, slavery or human trafficking by any Supplier.  As part of that commitment, we direct our\\nbusiness relationships to those suppliers, including our sourcing agents, vendors, factories and their own suppliers, who share our vision of ethical\\nand fair working conditions. Our Code of Conduct, which is based upon internationally accepted standards, including the International Labor\\nOrganization (ILO)’s core conventions and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, outlines the minimum standards that we require of our\\nsuppliers. In addition to these baseline expectations, suppliers must comply with all legal regulations and are encouraged to incorporate best\\npractices into their workplaces. Our Code must be communicated to all workers and supervisors and posted prominently in each represented\\nlanguage. Where issues of non-compliance are identified, we expect suppliers to take immediate steps to remediate and to demonstrate\\ncontinuous improvement. // CHILD LABOR\\nSuppliers must not employ any workers younger than the local minimum\\nage or the age for completion of compulsory education.

In such cases, the vendor must meet the ILO standards.\\nForced or Compulsory Labor\\nVendors must prohibit the use of forced or involuntary labor whether bonded, imprisoned, or\\nindentured, including debt servitude.

For the purpose of this SCoC, a minor or child is\\nconsidered to be a person under the age of eighteen (18) years of age. We recognize that we have the potential to be indirectly associated with human rights abuses in our supply chain, including child and forced labour. Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets out our expectations for suppliers working with Pan American Silver, including the requirement that they comply with our Global Code of Ethics and Global Human Rights Policy, which address the rights, cultural diversity, and customs of local communities and Indigenous Peoples. Employment Practices and Working Conditions – Third parties shall adopt employment practices that comply with applicable employment and labour laws and regulations as well as THIRD PARTY CODE OF CONDUCT 5/6 with internationally proclaimed human rights which include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions. This includes but is not limited to requirements regarding minimum wage, working hours, overtime, days of rest, compensation, and freedom of association. Third parties shall adopt employment practices that prohibit the use of forced labour, which includes work or service exacted under the threat of penalty (including imprisonment), or for which the person performing the work or service has not offered himself or herself voluntarily. No child shall be assigned to perform production tasks or any other activities of the company. The term \"child\" means a worker who is less than 14 years old or who is of an age at which school attendance is mandatory in his or her country. We encourage the use of workplace learning programs that comply with the applicable laws. Vendors must comply with all applicable child labour laws, including those related to\\nminimum age, hiring, wages, hours worked, overtime and working conditions. The minimum age for\\nfull time workers must not be less than 15 years of age, except as permitted in accordance with\\nInternational Labour Organization practices. Suppliers are committed to uphold the human rights of workers, and to treat them with dignity and respect as understood by the international community.\\n\\n The labour standards to be adhered to are as follows:\\n(i)     Freely Chosen Employment\\n\\nForced, bonded or indentured labour or involuntary prison labour is not to be used. All work will be voluntary, and workers should be free to leave upon reasonable notice. Workers shall not be required to hand over government-issued identification, passports or work permits as a condition of employment.\\n\\n \\n\\n(ii)   Child Labour Avoidance\\n\\nChild labour is not to be used in any stage of manufacturing or production. The term “child” refers to any person employed under the age of 15 (or 14 where the law of the country permits), or under the age for completing compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment in the country, whichever is greatest. The use of legitimate workplace apprenticeship programmes, which comply with all laws and regulations, is supported. Workers under the age of 18 should not perform hazardous work and may be restricted from night work with consideration given to educational needs. Suppliers must abide by applicable employment standards, labour, non-discrimination and human rights legislation. Where laws do not prohibit discrimination, or where they allow for differential treatment, we expect Suppliers to be committed to nondiscrimination principles and not to operate in a way that unfairly differentiates between individuals. Suppliers must be able to demonstrate that, in their workplaces: \\uf0b7 Child, forced, or compulsory labor is not used. \\uf0b7 Discrimination and harassment are prohibited, including discrimination or harassment based on any characteristic protected by law. \\uf0b7 Retaliation for speaking up is prohibited and employees are free to raise concerns and speak up without fear of reprisal. \\uf0b7 Appropriate and reasonable background screenings, including investigations for prior criminal activity, have been conducted to ensure the integrity and good character of the Supplier’s Employees. \\uf0b7 Clear and uniformly applied employment standards are used that meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. Child Labour In accordance with applicable Laws, and more specifically the ILO Conventions, the use of Child\\xa0Labour is strictly prohibited. The ILO’s International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) defines “Child Labour” as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to their physical or mental development, which includes work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and/or harmful to children and/or interferes with their schooling. According to IPEC, participation in some activities, including agricultural activities, is not always Child Labour. Age-appropriate tasks that are of lower risk and do not interfere with a child’s schooling and leisure time can be acceptable. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between light duties that do no harm to the child and Child Labour, which is work that interferes with compulsory schooling and damages health and personal development, based on hours and conditions of work, child’s age, activities performed and hazards involved. Consistent with the Code of Ethics and Conduct that applies to our employees and contractors, this Supplier Code of Conduct (the Code) is based upon generally accepted standards of ethical business conduct. We expect our suppliers to comply with this Code and all applicable laws and regulations wherever they operate. In the event that this Code imposes stricter requirements than local laws or regulations, or in the event that local laws or regulations impose stricter requirements than this Code, we expect our suppliers to comply with the stricter requirements. This Code goes beyond legal compliance, drawing upon internationally recognized standards, to advance social and environmental responsibility and business ethics, and is aligned with TELUS’ commitment to be a leading corporate citizen. // Child Labour Avoidance: It is expected that our suppliers do not use child labour in any part of their business operations. The minimum age for employment or work shall be 15 years of age (or 14 where the laws of the country permit) or the age for completing compulsory education in that country, whichever is higher. If any child labour is detected, the Supplier shall immediately stop such child labour and improve the supplier’s child labour avoidance practices. We encourage the use of workplace apprenticeship programs, provided they comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdiction in which they operate.  Suppliers are expected to have guidelines, policies, and\\npractices that are communicated throughout the organization,\\nupheld by all levels of management, and considered in and\\napplied to their own supply chain activities.// Suppliers are expected to have guidelines, policies, and\\npractices that are communicated throughout the organization,\\nupheld by all levels of management, and considered in and\\napplied to their own supply chain activities.

Suppliers are expected to know the origin of their materials, and shall not purchase materials or components made using forced labor, including but not limited to “Conflict Minerals” originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (see 17 CFR Part 240). This policy sets out the standards that we expect of ourselves and our suppliers. Additionally, we expect our suppliers to apply similar standards and principles with their suppliers throughout the supply chain.// Human Rights\\nStandard 1: Support and respect the protection of internationally recognized human\\nrights.\\nStandard 2: Ensure that the business is not complicit in human rights abuses.\\nLabor\\nStandard 3: Uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right\\nto collective bargaining.\\nStandard 4: Eliminate all forms of forced and compulsory labor.\\nStandard 5: Effectively abolish child labor. Suppliers must conform to the provisions of\\nthe ILO Convention 138 Minimum Age for Admission to Employment. The Partner Code of Conduct addresses minimum living wages, maximum working hours, and non-discrimination. It also emphasizes WES’s commitment to human rights, including zero tolerance for contractors involved in any type of forced labor, child labor, or corporal punishment. Adherence to the principles of the Partner Code of Conduct is a requirement for contractors in WES MSCs. Minimum Work Age – Suppliers shall not use any form of child labor within their organization or purchase materials or services from companies using underage labor. Forced Labor – Suppliers shall not use any form of forced, involuntary or slave labor within their organization or purchase materials or services from companies using forced, involuntary, or slave labor.

If the minimum employment age is not defined in a particular jurisdiction, it shall be the higher of 15 years of age or in compliance with laws. In cases where minors (individual under age 18 or as otherwise defined under a jurisdiction’s laws) are authorized to work, we expect our suppliers to observe all legal requirements, including but not limited to the number of hours and hours of the day for work, wages, minimum education and workingconditions. In these cases, suppliers should also ensure that minors do not perform work that might jeopardize their health, safety, or morals as described within the ILO Minimum Age Convention #138. If YETI believes that any Supplier has violated this Code of Conduct, YETI has the right to terminate its business relationship with the Supplier and to proceed to secure any and all other rights and remedies available to it under applicable law. YETI reserves the right to reasonably change the requirements of the Code of Conduct and, in such an event, expects the Supplier to accept such reasonable changes. // 2.

The mission of our Supplier Code of Conduct is to empower people, enhance economic justice, and improve the diversity of our vendor base. We expect all parties providing goods and services to us to conduct their business activities with the same high standards of business ethics, social responsibility, and environmental stewardship that we have committed to, and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. We have adopted a Supplier Code of Conduct that outlines our expectations for external vendors to establish and maintain a business relationship with Amalgamated Bank, supporting a professional environment where all are treated with respect and dignity, and in an environment where their health and safety are protected. As part of our initial screening process, we review third-party ESG scores and/or ask critical vendors to provide us with an overview of their CSRrelated initiatives. We review our list of active vendors on a regular basis to assess their continued alignment with Amalgamated’s mission and CSR-related policies. Vendor Management takes into consideration qualified women-owned, minority-owned, LGBT-owned, and other small businesses, as those businesses are an integral part of the community the Bank services. In addition, the Bank takes into consideration a vendor’s stance on civil rights, and its adherence to non-discriminatory practices. The Bank prioritizes hiring suppliers that utilize union labor with collective bargaining rights. Every vendor or supplier is subject to the Bank’s risk assessment and is carefully managed to limit exposure. At American Assets Trust, Inc. (“AAT”), we conduct business in accordance with the highest ethical\\nstandards, including working with vendors that hold themselves to such standards. // Conduct employment practices in compliance with all laws and regulations. • Comply with modern slavery laws, including, but not limited to, laws and regulations prohibiting slavery, servitude, force, compulsory labor, human trafficking and child labor. • Comply with all local minimum wage laws. • Comply with all local labor laws and standards regarding working hours, overtime and public holidays. • Provide a work environment free of discrimination and harassment based on gender, race, color, national origin, age, religion, marital status, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status or any other protected class.

Vendors will be committed to combating the exploitation of children, and therefore prohibit any use of child labor with any vendor, supplier or other third-party arrangements. Vendors must have hiring practices that verify accurately age and ability to work legally.

Workers must be no younger than the minimum age for employment under applicable law. \\uf0a7 Human Trafficking: Vendors should not engage in the recruiting, transporting, or use of forced, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, slavery, or trafficking of persons.

We expect our\\nvendors to fully comply with requirements of applicable slavery, forced labor\\nand human trafficking laws. //Vendors must not employ child labor, and should take the necessary preventive\\nmeasures to ensure that they do not employ anyone under the applicable legal\\nminimum age of employment. Such measures include age verification systems,\\ntraining for managers, and communicating with sub- vendors and suppliers on\\nchild labor issues. The core principles of COPT’s Vendor Code of Business Conduct and Ethics are as follows: Compliance with Applicable Laws, including Child Labor laws. Vendors must at all times comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations andordinances.

Even where laws do not prohibit discrimination, or where they allow for differential treatment, we expect Suppliers to be committed to nondiscrimination principles and not to operate in a way that unfairly differentiates between individuals. Suppliers must be able to demonstrate that, in their workplaces: • Child, forced, or compulsory labour is not used. • Discrimination and harassment are prohibited. Minimum Age for Employment. You do not employ anyone under the legal working age as defined by local law and follow all applicable laws and regulations regarding child labor. • Forced Labor.

The RBA Code of Conduct is a set of standards on social, environmental and ethical issues in the electronics industry supply chain, including responsible operations and management in labor, health & safety, environmental and ethics. The latest version of RBA Code of Conduct can be found at http://www.responsiblebusiness.org/standards/code-ofconduct/. // As part of our commitment to corporate social responsibility, and to respecting human rights in our\\noperations and global supply chain, Fabrinet has adopted the RBA policy for conflict minerals and its\\nreporting format. Because of this, we expect our suppliers to do so too, and to have policies and due\\ndiligence measures in place that will enable us to be reasonably sure that components and materials\\nsupplied to us are conflict-minerals free, so we in turn can assure our customers of that too.

We have zero-tolerance for forced labor, modern slavery, and human trafficking in our business, and expect\\nthe same from Suppliers.\\nForced, bonded, compulsory, or child labor, or those below the minimum legal employment age for their respective\\njurisdiction, should not be employed by the Supplier. It is the Supplier’s own responsibility to verify the age of its\\nemployees and maintain a copy of its employee’s proof of age. SL Green Realty Corp is committed to dealing fairly with its tenants, contractors, real estate brokers/agents, partners/joint ventures, lenders, customers, suppliers, competitors, employees, and other third parties. An important part of adhering to this commitment is selecting and working with suppliers that maintain transparency and comply with all applicable standards and regulations regarding ethics, environmental, and social issues. This Vendor Code of Conduct is intended to outline the fundamental expectations of suppliers in regard to SL Green’s primary procurement values: ethics, environmental standards, human rights, and health and safety.// SL Green is opposed to child and forced labor in any form, including\\namong suppliers. SL Green adheres to the conventions of the International Labor Organization\\nprinciples in these areas, including C183 – Minimum Age Convention, C182 Worst Forms of Child\\nLabour Convention and P029 – Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labor Convention. Respect and promote human rights in accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. \\x83 Ensure all work is voluntary. \\x83 Not traffic persons or use any form of slave, forced, bonded, indentured, or prison labor. \\x83 Ensure worker access to work-related documents. Vendors are discouraged from requiring workers to lodge “deposits”, holding employee identity or immigration papers (including by not limited to passports or work permits), or destroying, concealing, confiscating or otherwise denying worker’s access to such documents. Ensure workers are free to resign their employment in accordance with local and national laws or regulations without unlawful penalty. Vendors who employ workers who are not a national of the country in which the work is taking place, and who were brought into that country for the purpose of working for the vendor, should provide return transportation to the worker’s origin, or reimburse the worker for the cost of such trip upon the end of employment. Due to the nature of our business as a triple-net REIT, our use of vendors is fairly limited. However, Spirit expects any vendor it utilizes to have the same commitment and adherence to ethical standards as Spirit does, including compliance with applicable laws related to human rights such as prohibiting child and forced labor, and human trafficking and implementing and maintaining health and safety policies and procedures of employees and workplace facilities. As set forth in the Company’s Human Rights Policy, we are committed to the protection of fundamental human rights and expect the same commitment from Vendors. We expect Vendors to ensure that all labor is voluntary and that they are not supporting or engaging slavery or human trafficking in any part of their supply chain. We expect that Vendors will not, and will ensure that their Partners do not, support or engage in, or require any: • compelled, involuntary, or forced labor; • labor to be performed by children; • bonded labor; • indentured labor; or • prison labor. Follow all laws governing wages and working hours, including laws related to child labor, minimum age requirements, fair compensation, benefits and overtime Conduct employment practices in accordance with all laws and regulations including, but not limited to, prohibiting the use of involuntary and child labor, complying with wage and hour laws and, if applicable, affording employees freedom of association and the opportunity to engage in collective bargaining. Suppliers commit to not using any form of forced or involuntary labor,\\nwhether prison, bonded, indentured or otherwise. Workers must not be\\nrequired to lodge “deposits” or their identity papers with their employer\\nand must be free to leave their employer after reasonable notic WeWork is committed to acting with integrity in our business dealings and in our supply chains. We aim to implement and enforce effective systems and controls that promote workplaces free from child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking, while also supporting fair wages and safe and humane working conditions. We expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, Vendors, and other business partners.  No Child Labor WeWork does not tolerate child labor. Vendors shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their country of production or operations regarding age appropriate work.   Vendors should take appropriate measures to ensure that no workers under the legal age for employment are used at their own place of production or operations or at their subcontractors’ place(s) of production or operations.  Vendors should protect young workers of legal working age from any type of employment or work likely to jeopardise their health, safety or morals.  According to law, this includes preventing young workers from performing hazardous jobs and avoiding night shifts, and ensuring minimum wages. //No Forced Labor WeWork has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery. Forced or bonded labor must never be used in the production or services supplied to WeWork. For more information regarding our Modern Slavery statement, please see www.wework.com/legal/uk-modern-slavery-statement.  Vendors shall comply with relevant national and international laws and regulations and provisions applicable in their country of production or operations.  Vendors should take appropriate measures to ensure that no forced labor occurs at their own place of production or operations or at their subcontractors’ place(s) of production or operations. Vendor is expected to follow all applicable Laws in the countries, states, and municipalities in which it operates, as well as in compliance with International Labor Organization (ILO) standards, and be committed to the value of, and respect for, all people. Vendor is responsible for respecting human rights in its operations and will comply with the standards set forth in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The standards set forth in this Code apply to all workers, including, without limitation, temporary, student, contract, direct employees, and any other type of worker of Vendor. The applicable labor standards are: 1. Child Labor. Vendor will not engage in or condone the unlawful employment or exploitation of children in the workplace. Vendor will be committed to combating the exploitation of children, and therefore prohibit any use of child labor with any vendor, supplier or other thirdparty arrangements. Vendor is expected to cooperate with law enforcement authorities to address any such instances of which Vendor becomes aware. 2. Human Trafficking, Slavery and the Right to Voluntary Labor. Vendor will respect the free choice of all persons and strictly prohibit forced or compulsory labor for any employees. Vendor will refrain from doing business with, tolerate, or associate with organizations or entities that condone or are engaged in the practice of coercing or imposing work with little or no freedom of choice. Vendor will comply with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and will cooperate with law enforcement to address such instances that come to the attention of Vendor. The use of child labor is prohibited. No person under the age of 15 (or under 14 where\\npermitted by local law) may be employed. Workers under the age of 18 may not perform\\nwork that is likely to jeopardize their health or safety. This Vendor Code of Conduct ensures that our Supply Chain Partners operate in a manner which is aligned with A&F’s principles and values, as reflected in A&F’s Code of Business Conduct. //Bribery and refusal by a factory to be audited are considered a “zero tolerance” finding, and, if found, A&F will stop business with the factory.//Child Labor\\nA&F will not tolerate the use of child labor by its vendors. ‘Child Labor’ is defined as the employment of persons younger than the age of 15, the local legal minimum working age, or the local legal age for compulsory education, whichever is older.\\n\\nJuvenile Workers\\nJuvenile workers are those workers under the age of 18. Vendors must restrict working hours and obtain necessary approvals, including permits and medical exams, for juveniles as prescribed by local law. Juveniles are not permitted to work in conditions that may be overnight, hazardous and/or impede the juvenile worker’s development. Health checks and work registration is to be required for juvenile workers. A tracking system or register for all juvenile workers must be in place.\\n\\nInvoluntary Forced Labor & Human Trafficking\\nA&F will not tolerate the use of convict, indentured, slave, prison, bonded, or other forced involuntary labor, including human trafficking, either directly or indirectly, by its vendors, and subcontractors, or agency-hired workers utilized by its vendors. All workers, both foreign and national, must be treated equally, and will not be required to pay fees or commissions to agencies or the factory in exchange for employment. Workers shall have the right to leave the employer after providing reasonable notice. At Alaska Air Group, Inc. (AAG) we take great pride in caring for our companies’ customers, communities, planet, and\\nairlines. Our companies’ suppliers provide countless functions across the AAG network and we rely on them to be safe,\\nethical, and to help us achieve our business goals. This Supplier Code of Conduct describes AAG companies’\\nexpectations of Suppliers.  Child labor is impermissible. The term “child” refers to any person under the age of 15, under\\nthe age for completing compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment in\\nthe country, whichever is greater. It is permissible to utilize legitimate workplace\\napprenticeship programs that comply with all relevant laws and regulations. Workers under\\nthe age of 18 (Young Workers) shall not perform work that is likely to jeopardize their health\\nor safety, including nightshift and overtime. As it pertains to student workers, Suppliers must\\nensure proper management of student records, continued, thorough diligence of educational\\npartners, and protection of students’ rights in accordance with applicable law and\\nregulations. Supplier shall provide appropriate support and training to all student workers. In\\nthe absence of local law, the wage rate for student workers, interns and apprentices shall\\nbe at least the same wage rate as other entry-level workers performing equal or similar\\ntasks. This Supplier Code of Conduct (the “Code”) sets forth the basic requirements that all Suppliers must comply\\nwith when doing business with Alliance Data. The Code helps us ensure that Alliance Data and the Suppliers\\nwho help us achieve our success, conduct business with the utmost integrity. Much like our associates are\\nheld to a Code of Ethics, we expect the same from you as a Supplier.   //   Alliance Data treats its associates and all our partners with professionalism, dignity and respect. We will not\\ntolerate the use of child or forced labor, slavery or human trafficking by any Supplier.  As part of that commitment, we direct our\\nbusiness relationships to those suppliers, including our sourcing agents, vendors, factories and their own suppliers, who share our vision of ethical\\nand fair working conditions. Our Code of Conduct, which is based upon internationally accepted standards, including the International Labor\\nOrganization (ILO)’s core conventions and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, outlines the minimum standards that we require of our\\nsuppliers. In addition to these baseline expectations, suppliers must comply with all legal regulations and are encouraged to incorporate best\\npractices into their workplaces. Our Code must be communicated to all workers and supervisors and posted prominently in each represented\\nlanguage. Where issues of non-compliance are identified, we expect suppliers to take immediate steps to remediate and to demonstrate\\ncontinuous improvement. // CHILD LABOR\\nSuppliers must not employ any workers younger than the local minimum\\nage or the age for completion of compulsory education. Regardless of local\\nlaw, suppliers must not employ any workers younger than the age of 15.\\nSuppliers must comply with local requirements for workers under the age\\nof 18 to ensure that they are provided with safe conditions. Child Labor\\nVendors must prohibit the employment of individuals under the legal minimum working age of\\nthe jurisdiction or country where the vendor operates, unless that requirement is below the\\nstandards established by the International Labor Organization (ILO) (generally requires workers\\nto be 15 years or older for non-hazardous conditions and 16 or older for positions identified as\\npotentially hazardous). In such cases, the vendor must meet the ILO standards.\\nForced or Compulsory Labor\\nVendors must prohibit the use of forced or involuntary labor whether bonded, imprisoned, or\\nindentured, including debt servitude. We expect our Vendors to respect human rights and provide fair working conditions in accordance with all labor laws and human rights laws in relevant jurisdictions. Anaplan prohibits the use of any slavery, servitude, forced, compulsory, or child labor and human trafficking by Vendor or any organization in Vendor’s supply chain. Vendor must not use or permit any form of forced, bonded, or indentured labor. Vendor must not unreasonably restrict workers’ freedom to move into, out of, or around at working facilities. Vendor must not hold workers’ identity, immigration, or work permit documents longer than reasonably necessary for administrative processing. This applies to all workers, including temporary, student, intern, contract, migrant, direct, or any other type of worker. This Supplier Code of Conduct establishes ethical guidelines for suppliers working with Atlantic Union Bank. Atlantic Union Bank expects suppliers providing goods and services to the bank to comply with this Supplier Code of Conduct. Suppliers are also responsible for ensuring that their employees and subcontractors are made aware of, understand, and agree to comply with the Supplier Code of Conduct.//Suppliers will not use any form of forced labor, including bonded labor, forced prison labor,\\nslavery, involuntary servitude, or human trafficking.\\nSuppliers will not use child labor. Suppliers are required to comply with applicable child labor\\nlaws and employ only workers who meet the applicable minimum legal age requirements in their\\ncountries of operation.

All suppliers must prohibit and renounce the use of children and adolescents for sexual purposes (including in exchange for money or items of value), child labor, forced labor and slave-like labor. Evidence of any of these practices will lead to trade sanctions being brought by Bladex and its group companies. We recommend that suppliers take actions to combat and overcome the exploitation of the illegal and irregular working conditions referred to above. Vendors shall not use child labor.  For purposes of this Code, “Child” means being of the age for compulsory schooling\\nand, in any case, shall not be less than 15 years.

Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets out our expectations for suppliers working with Pan American Silver, including the requirement that they comply with our Global Code of Ethics and Global Human Rights Policy, which address the rights, cultural diversity, and customs of local communities and Indigenous Peoples. Employment Practices and Working Conditions – Third parties shall adopt employment practices that comply with applicable employment and labour laws and regulations as well as THIRD PARTY CODE OF CONDUCT 5/6 with internationally proclaimed human rights which include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions. This includes but is not limited to requirements regarding minimum wage, working hours, overtime, days of rest, compensation, and freedom of association. Third parties shall adopt employment practices that prohibit the use of forced labour, which includes work or service exacted under the threat of penalty (including imprisonment), or for which the person performing the work or service has not offered himself or herself voluntarily. No child shall be assigned to perform production tasks or any other activities of the company. The term \"child\" means a worker who is less than 14 years old or who is of an age at which school attendance is mandatory in his or her country. We encourage the use of workplace learning programs that comply with the applicable laws. Vendors must comply with all applicable child labour laws, including those related to\\nminimum age, hiring, wages, hours worked, overtime and working conditions. The minimum age for\\nfull time workers must not be less than 15 years of age, except as permitted in accordance with\\nInternational Labour Organization practices. Suppliers are committed to uphold the human rights of workers, and to treat them with dignity and respect as understood by the international community.\\n\\n The labour standards to be adhered to are as follows:\\n(i)     Freely Chosen Employment\\n\\nForced, bonded or indentured labour or involuntary prison labour is not to be used. All work will be voluntary, and workers should be free to leave upon reasonable notice. Workers shall not be required to hand over government-issued identification, passports or work permits as a condition of employment.\\n\\n \\n\\n(ii)   Child Labour Avoidance\\n\\nChild labour is not to be used in any stage of manufacturing or production. The term “child” refers to any person employed under the age of 15 (or 14 where the law of the country permits), or under the age for completing compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment in the country, whichever is greatest. The use of legitimate workplace apprenticeship programmes, which comply with all laws and regulations, is supported. Workers under the age of 18 should not perform hazardous work and may be restricted from night work with consideration given to educational needs. Suppliers must abide by applicable employment standards, labour, non-discrimination and human rights legislation. Where laws do not prohibit discrimination, or where they allow for differential treatment, we expect Suppliers to be committed to nondiscrimination principles and not to operate in a way that unfairly differentiates between individuals. Suppliers must be able to demonstrate that, in their workplaces: \\uf0b7 Child, forced, or compulsory labor is not used. \\uf0b7 Discrimination and harassment are prohibited, including discrimination or harassment based on any characteristic protected by law. \\uf0b7 Retaliation for speaking up is prohibited and employees are free to raise concerns and speak up without fear of reprisal. \\uf0b7 Appropriate and reasonable background screenings, including investigations for prior criminal activity, have been conducted to ensure the integrity and good character of the Supplier’s Employees. \\uf0b7 Clear and uniformly applied employment standards are used that meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. Child Labour In accordance with applicable Laws, and more specifically the ILO Conventions, the use of Child\\xa0Labour is strictly prohibited. The ILO’s International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) defines “Child Labour” as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to their physical or mental development, which includes work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and/or harmful to children and/or interferes with their schooling. According to IPEC, participation in some activities, including agricultural activities, is not always Child Labour. Age-appropriate tasks that are of lower risk and do not interfere with a child’s schooling and leisure time can be acceptable. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between light duties that do no harm to the child and Child Labour, which is work that interferes with compulsory schooling and damages health and personal development, based on hours and conditions of work, child’s age, activities performed and hazards involved. Consistent with the Code of Ethics and Conduct that applies to our employees and contractors, this Supplier Code of Conduct (the Code) is based upon generally accepted standards of ethical business conduct. We expect our suppliers to comply with this Code and all applicable laws and regulations wherever they operate. In the event that this Code imposes stricter requirements than local laws or regulations, or in the event that local laws or regulations impose stricter requirements than this Code, we expect our suppliers to comply with the stricter requirements. This Code goes beyond legal compliance, drawing upon internationally recognized standards, to advance social and environmental responsibility and business ethics, and is aligned with TELUS’ commitment to be a leading corporate citizen. // Child Labour Avoidance: It is expected that our suppliers do not use child labour in any part of their business operations. The minimum age for employment or work shall be 15 years of age (or 14 where the laws of the country permit) or the age for completing compulsory education in that country, whichever is higher. If any child labour is detected, the Supplier shall immediately stop such child labour and improve the supplier’s child labour avoidance practices. We encourage the use of workplace apprenticeship programs, provided they comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdiction in which they operate.  Suppliers are expected to have guidelines, policies, and\\npractices that are communicated throughout the organization,\\nupheld by all levels of management, and considered in and\\napplied to their own supply chain activities.// Suppliers are expected to have guidelines, policies, and\\npractices that are communicated throughout the organization,\\nupheld by all levels of management, and considered in and\\napplied to their own supply chain activities.

For purposes of this Manual, a “child” is determined and established by Law.. Temporary workplace internships, apprenticeship education programs for younger persons, and customary seasonal employment, so long as such persons are closely supervised and their morals, safety, health, and compulsory education are not compromised in any way, may be exceptions to the prohibition; in no event, however, shall such individuals be involved directly with the manufacturing process.  4 Forced Labor and Human Trafficking SGC will not tolerate the use of any forced or involuntary labor, either directly or indirectly, by any of SGC’s Suppliers or any of their suppliers or vendors. This includes the use of slave labor, bonded labor, indentured labor, or involuntary convict labor. Nor will we tolerate the trafficking, physical punishment, or abuse of any worker. As part of the hiring process, workers must be provided with a written employment agreement in their native language that contains a description of terms and conditions of employment prior to the worker departing from his or her country of origin. Workers cannot be required to surrender their identity papers or other original personal documents or pay deposits as a condition of employment. Suppliers shall maintain adequate policies and procedures to ensure that workers are not recruited by third party brokers and have not been charged recruitment fees during their recruitment process. Workers must be free to leave the workplace at the end of their shift and to resign without repercussion. All overtime should be voluntary and should not be in excess of legal limits. We expect our Suppliers with whom we do business to uphold the same principles.

Supplier Code of Conduct Our Supplier Code of Conduct (“Supplier Code”) applies to both domestic and foreign producers and manufacturers that supply us with goods and services. It focuses on worker rights and protections, with a particular emphasis on the importance of protecting the human rights and safe working conditions of workers in our supply chain. This includes policies prohibiting child, forced and trafficked labour, as well as any discrimination, intimidation, abuse, harassment or violence against these workers. We require that our suppliers share our Supplier Code with their contractors, agents, sub-contractors and sub-agents, including any labour agencies that are engaged to assist with providing goods or performing services for Loblaw. Furthermore, our Supplier Code requires compliance with laws respecting workers’ freedom of association and right to collectively bargain their terms and conditions of employment, which include compensation and working hours. Our Supplier Code is managed through our Compliance and Ethics department and is reviewed annually and updated as necessary. Standards and Human Rights Magna is committed to complying with all applicable labour, employment, and human rights laws, and we demand the same commitment from our suppliers. Our suppliers must therefore follow local laws on minimum wages, benefits, overtime, work hours, and working conditions. Our suppliers are never permitted to use forced or compulsory labour. Suppliers are also prohibited from using underage labour, as defined by local labour law, unless it is part of a government-approved training or apprenticeship program that clearly benefits the participants. Suppliers should also respect employee freedom of association and choice with respect to the issue of unions or works council affiliation, consistent with local laws.

Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets out our expectations for suppliers working with Pan American Silver, including the requirement that they comply with our Global Code of Ethics and Global Human Rights Policy, which address the rights, cultural diversity, and customs of local communities and Indigenous Peoples. Employment Practices and Working Conditions – Third parties shall adopt employment practices that comply with applicable employment and labour laws and regulations as well as THIRD PARTY CODE OF CONDUCT 5/6 with internationally proclaimed human rights which include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions. This includes but is not limited to requirements regarding minimum wage, working hours, overtime, days of rest, compensation, and freedom of association. Third parties shall adopt employment practices that prohibit the use of forced labour, which includes work or service exacted under the threat of penalty (including imprisonment), or for which the person performing the work or service has not offered himself or herself voluntarily. No child shall be assigned to perform production tasks or any other activities of the company. The term \"child\" means a worker who is less than 14 years old or who is of an age at which school attendance is mandatory in his or her country. We encourage the use of workplace learning programs that comply with the applicable laws. Vendors must comply with all applicable child labour laws, including those related to\n",

    "Forced, bonded or indentured labour or involuntary prison labour is not to be used. All work will be voluntary, and workers should be free to leave upon reasonable notice.

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "(ii)   Child Labour Avoidance\n",
    "\n",
    "Child labour is not to be used in any stage of manufacturing or production. The term “child” refers to any person employed under the age of 15 (or 14 where the law of the country permits), or under the age for completing compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment in the country, whichever is greatest. The use of legitimate workplace apprenticeship programmes, which comply with all laws and regulations, is supported. Workers under the age of 18 should not perform hazardous work and may be restricted from night work with consideration given to educational needs. Suppliers must abide by applicable employment standards, labour, non-discrimination and human rights legislation. Where laws do not prohibit discrimination, or where they allow for differential treatment, we expect Suppliers to be committed to nondiscrimination principles and not to operate in a way that unfairly differentiates between individuals. Suppliers must be able to demonstrate that, in their workplaces:  Child, forced, or compulsory labor is not used.  Discrimination and harassment are prohibited, including discrimination or harassment based on any characteristic protected by law.  Retaliation for speaking up is prohibited and employees are free to raise concerns and speak up without fear of reprisal.  Appropriate and reasonable background screenings, including investigations for prior criminal activity, have been conducted to ensure the integrity and good character of the Supplier’s Employees.  Clear and uniformly applied employment standards are used that meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. Child Labour In accordance with applicable Laws, and more specifically the ILO Conventions, the use of Child Labour is strictly prohibited. The ILO’s International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) defines “Child Labour” as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to their physical or mental development, which includes work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and/or harmful to children and/or interferes with their schooling. According to IPEC, participation in some activities, including agricultural activities, is not always Child Labour. Age-appropriate tasks that are of lower risk and do not interfere with a child’s schooling and leisure time can be acceptable. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between light duties that do no harm to the child and Child Labour, which is work that interferes with compulsory schooling and damages health and personal development, based on hours and conditions of work, child’s age, activities performed and hazards involved. Consistent with the Code of Ethics and Conduct that applies to our employees and contractors, this Supplier Code of Conduct (the Code) is based upon generally accepted standards of ethical business conduct. We expect our suppliers to comply with this Code and all applicable laws and regulations wherever they operate. In the event that this Code imposes stricter requirements than local laws or regulations, or in the event that local laws or regulations impose stricter requirements than this Code, we expect our suppliers to comply with the stricter requirements. This Code goes beyond legal compliance, drawing upon internationally recognized standards, to advance social and environmental responsibility and business ethics, and is aligned with TELUS’ commitment to be a leading corporate citizen. // Child Labour Avoidance: It is expected that our suppliers do not use child labour in any part of their business operations. The minimum age for employment or work shall be 15 years of age (or 14 where the laws of the country permit) or the age for completing compulsory education in that country, whichever is higher. If any child labour is detected, the Supplier shall immediately stop such child labour and improve the supplier’s child labour avoidance practices. We encourage the use of workplace apprenticeship programs, provided they comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdiction in which they operate.  Suppliers are expected to have guidelines, policies, and\n",

The supplier only employs on a voluntary basis and does not recognize any forms of involuntary labor or forced labor; including prison, slave, bonded, forced or indentured labor of any kind. Engaging in forms of compulsory labor, or any other forms of slavery or human trafficking, will not be acceptable.

IV. Rationale Nordson will not tolerate the use of unlawful child labor or forced labor in the manufacture of products it sells and will not accept products or services from Suppliers that employ or utilize child labor or forced labor in any manner. Human trafficking and slavery are crimes under state, federal and international law. These crimes exist in countries throughout the world. This Policy is to define how Nordson will make efforts to eradicate human trafficking and slavery from not only within its organization but also from our supply chains. Freely Chosen Employment - Suppliers shall not use any forced labor, whether in the form of\n",
    "prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or otherwise. Each supplier shall: (i) refrain from\n",
    "engaging in any acts of “slavery or human trafficking” as such terms are defined, inter alia, in\n",
    "Section 54(12) of the UK Modern Slavery Act (2015), as such act may from time to time be\n",
    "amended (the “UK Modern Slavery Act”); and (ii) take commercially reasonable steps to ensure\n",
    "that its subcontractors and suppliers do not engage in any such acts, regardless of whether such\n",
    "supplier or its subcontractors or suppliers is subject to the UK Modern Slavery Act.\n",
    " No Child Labor - Suppliers shall comply with local minimum working age laws and requirements\n",
    "and not employ child labor Suppliers are committed to uphold the human rights of workers, and to treat them with dignity and respect as understood by the international community and proclaimed under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization's core conventions. // Forced, bonded or indentured labor or involuntary prison labor shall not be used under any circumstances. All workers will be voluntary, and workers should be free to leave upon reasonable notice.

Suppliers’ policies and practices should result in employment decisions being made on the basis of the workers’ ability to do the job, and not on their personal characteristics or beliefs. Freedom of Association. Open communication and direct engagement with workers to resolve workplace and compensation issues is encouraged. Suppliers shall respect the rights of workers, as set forth in local laws, to associate freely, join or not join labor unions, seek representation and join workers’ councils. Workers shall be able to communicate openly with management reg Child Labor: Prohibit the employment of individuals under the legal minimum working age of the jurisdiction or country where the supplier operates, or under the standards established by the International Labor Organization (ILO) whichever is greater.

The prohibition of forced labor is an important element of RLC’s Operating Standards . Due to reports of widespread forced labor and in some cases, child labor used to harvest the cotton fields in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, we have joined other brands and retailers to voice our concern with a goal to eliminate this practice. Our expectations are that our business partners will not knowingly source cotton from Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Suppliers shall not traffic in persons or use any form of slave, forced, bonded, indentured, or involuntary prison labor. This includes the transportation, harboring, recruitment, transfer, or receipt of persons by means of threat, force, coercion, abduction, fraud, or payments to any person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation. As part of this commitment to prohibiting human trafficking, Suppliers may not engage in any of the following conduct: 1. Destroying, concealing, or confiscating identity or immigration documents; 2. Using fraudulent recruiting tactics; or 3. Charging employees unreasonable recruitment fees or providing inadequate housing based on local standards, laws and directives. // Child labor is strictly prohibited. Suppliers shall not employ children. The minimum age for employment or work shall be 16 years of age, the minimum age for employment in that country, or the age for completing compulsory education in that country, whichever is higher.

    " JOI is committed to fair labor practices within our supply chain. To that end, all of our suppliers are required to agree and comply with JOI’s Supplier Statement of Basic Standards as part of our contracting process. The Supplier Statement of Basic Standards includes prohibitions against child labor, forced or prison labor, and mandates that suppliers provide appropriate compensation and work environments for their workers.

Vendors are discouraged from requiring workers to lodge “deposits”, holding employee identity or immigration papers (including by not limited to passports or work permits), or destroying, concealing, confiscating or otherwise denying worker’s access to such documents. Ensure workers are free to resign their employment in accordance with local and national laws or regulations without unlawful penalty. Vendors who employ workers who are not a national of the country in which the work is taking place, and who were brought into that country for the purpose of working for the vendor, should provide return transportation to the worker’s origin, or reimburse the worker for the cost of such trip upon the end of employment.

We expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, Vendors, and other business partners.  No Child Labor WeWork does not tolerate child labor. Vendors shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their country of production or operations regarding age appropriate work.   Vendors should take appropriate measures to ensure that no workers under the legal age for employment are used at their own place of production or operations or at their subcontractors’ place(s) of production or operations.  Vendors should protect young workers of legal working age from any type of employment or work likely to jeopardise their health, safety or morals.  According to law, this includes preventing young workers from performing hazardous jobs and avoiding night shifts, and ensuring minimum wages. //No Forced Labor WeWork has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery. Forced or bonded labor must never be used in the production or services supplied to WeWork. For more information regarding our Modern Slavery statement, please see www.wework.com/legal/uk-modern-slavery-statement.

Vendor is responsible for respecting human rights in its operations and will comply with the standards set forth in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The standards set forth in this Code apply to all workers, including, without limitation, temporary, student, contract, direct employees, and any other type of worker of Vendor. The applicable labor standards are: 1. Child Labor. Vendor will not engage in or condone the unlawful employment or exploitation of children in the workplace. Vendor will be committed to combating the exploitation of children, and therefore prohibit any use of child labor with any vendor, supplier or other thirdparty arrangements. Vendor is expected to cooperate with law enforcement authorities to address any such instances of which Vendor becomes aware. 2. Human Trafficking, Slavery and the Right to Voluntary Labor. Vendor will respect the free choice of all persons and strictly prohibit forced or compulsory labor for any employees. Vendor will refrain from doing business with, tolerate, or associate with organizations or entities that condone or are engaged in the practice of coercing or imposing work with little or no freedom of choice. Vendor will comply with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and will cooperate with law enforcement to address such instances that come to the attention of Vendor.

Supplier Code of Conduct Our Supplier Code of Conduct (“Supplier Code”) applies to both domestic and foreign producers and manufacturers that supply us with goods and services.

This includes policies prohibiting child, forced and trafficked labour, as well as any discrimination, intimidation, abuse, harassment or violence against these workers.

Furthermore, our Supplier Code requires compliance with laws respecting workers’ freedom of association and right to collectively bargain their terms and conditions of employment, which include compensation and working hours. Our Supplier Code is managed through our Compliance and Ethics department and is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.

Our suppliers must therefore follow local laws on minimum wages, benefits, overtime, work hours, and working conditions. Our suppliers are never permitted to use forced or compulsory labour. Suppliers are also prohibited from using underage labour, as defined by local labour law, unless it is part of a government-approved training or apprenticeship program that clearly benefits the participants.

    "(ii)   Child Labour Avoidance\n",
    "\n",
    "Child labour is not to be used in any stage of manufacturing or production. The term “child” refers to any person employed under the age of 15 (or 14 where the law of the country permits), or under the age for completing compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment in the country, whichever is greatest. The use of legitimate workplace apprenticeship programmes, which comply with all laws and regulations, is supported. Workers under the age of 18 should not perform hazardous work and may be restricted from night work with consideration given to educational needs. Suppliers must abide by applicable employment standards, labour, non-discrimination and human rights legislation. Where laws do not prohibit discrimination, or where they allow for differential treatment, we expect Suppliers to be committed to nondiscrimination principles and not to operate in a way that unfairly differentiates between individuals. Suppliers must be able to demonstrate that, in their workplaces:  Child, forced, or compulsory labor is not used.  Discrimination and harassment are prohibited, including discrimination or harassment based on any characteristic protected by law.  Retaliation for speaking up is prohibited and employees are free to raise concerns and speak up without fear of reprisal.  Appropriate and reasonable background screenings, including investigations for prior criminal activity, have been conducted to ensure the integrity and good character of the Supplier’s Employees.  Clear and uniformly applied employment standards are used that meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. Child Labour In accordance with applicable Laws, and more specifically the ILO Conventions, the use of Child Labour is strictly prohibited. The ILO’s International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) defines “Child Labour” as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to their physical or mental development, which includes work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and/or harmful to children and/or interferes with their schooling. According to IPEC, participation in some activities, including agricultural activities, is not always Child Labour. Age-appropriate tasks that are of lower risk and do not interfere with a child’s schooling and leisure time can be acceptable. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between light duties that do no harm to the child and Child Labour, which is work that interferes with compulsory schooling and damages health and personal development, based on hours and conditions of work, child’s age, activities performed and hazards involved. Consistent with the Code of Ethics and Conduct that applies to our employees and contractors, this Supplier Code of Conduct (the Code) is based upon generally accepted standards of ethical business conduct. We expect our suppliers to comply with this Code and all applicable laws and regulations wherever they operate. In the event that this Code imposes stricter requirements than local laws or regulations, or in the event that local laws or regulations impose stricter requirements than this Code, we expect our suppliers to comply with the stricter requirements. This Code goes beyond legal compliance, drawing upon internationally recognized standards, to advance social and environmental responsibility and business ethics, and is aligned with TELUS’ commitment to be a leading corporate citizen. // Child Labour Avoidance: It is expected that our suppliers do not use child labour in any part of their business operations. The minimum age for employment or work shall be 15 years of age (or 14 where the laws of the country permit) or the age for completing compulsory education in that country, whichever is higher. If any child labour is detected, the Supplier shall immediately stop such child labour and improve the supplier’s child labour avoidance practices. We encourage the use of workplace apprenticeship programs, provided they comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdiction in which they operate.  Suppliers are expected to have guidelines, policies, and\n",

Comply with all applicable labor and human rights laws and regulations, including those regarding immigration, minimum wage, overtime, payday, forced labor and child labor Forced Labor: all work or service, not voluntarily performed, that is obtained from an individual under the threat of force or penalty. Harmful Child Labor: consists of the employment of children that is economically exploitative, or is likely to be hazardous to, or interfere with, the child’s education, or to be harmful to the child’s health, or physical, mental, spiritual, moral, or social development. IV. Rationale Nordson will not tolerate the use of unlawful child labor or forced labor in the manufacture of products it sells and will not accept products or services from Suppliers that employ or utilize child labor or forced labor in any manner. Human trafficking and slavery are crimes under state, federal and international law. These crimes exist in countries throughout the world. This Policy is to define how Nordson will make efforts to eradicate human trafficking and slavery from not only within its organization but also from our supply chains. Freely Chosen Employment - Suppliers shall not use any forced labor, whether in the form of\n",
    "prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or otherwise. Each supplier shall: (i) refrain from\n",
    "engaging in any acts of “slavery or human trafficking” as such terms are defined, inter alia, in\n",
    "Section 54(12) of the UK Modern Slavery Act (2015), as such act may from time to time be\n",
    "amended (the “UK Modern Slavery Act”); and (ii) take commercially reasonable steps to ensure\n",
    "that its subcontractors and suppliers do not engage in any such acts, regardless of whether such\n",
    "supplier or its subcontractors or suppliers is subject to the UK Modern Slavery Act.\n",
    " No Child Labor - Suppliers shall comply with local minimum working age laws and requirements\n",
    "and not employ child labor Suppliers are committed to uphold the human rights of workers, and to treat them with dignity and respect as understood by the international community and proclaimed under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization's core conventions. // Forced, bonded or indentured labor or involuntary prison labor shall not be used under any circumstances. All workers will be voluntary, and workers should be free to leave upon reasonable notice. Workers shall not be required to surrender government-issued identification, passports or work permits as a condition of employment.\n",

    "association, privacy, collective bargaining, immigration, working time, wages, and hours, as well as laws prohibiting forced,\n",
    "compulsory and child labor, and employment discrimination. NRG requires the same commitment from all of our suppliers,\n",
    "including their employees and subcontractors while working on NRG property or elsewhere on behalf of NRG. Bey a) Suppliers must not utilize involuntary labor of any type. This shall include, but not be limited to, forced, indentured, bonded or prison labor. b) Suppliers must not utilize child labor. For purposes of the Code, a “child” will be considered any person younger than (i) fourteen (14) years old; (ii) the minimum age for completing compulsory education in the country of manufacture; or (iii) the minimum age for employment in such country, whichever is the highest.
